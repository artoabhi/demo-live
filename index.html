            <h3>Anion Chip Technology</h3>
            <p><strong>What is Anion Chip Technology?</strong></p>
            <p>
              Anion chip technology is a revolutionary feature infused in
              sanitary pads, designed to enhance hygiene, comfort, and overall
              menstrual health. The chip emits negative ions (anions) that offer
              natural antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and odor-neutralizing
              benefits.
            </p>
            <div class="how-it-works">
              <h4>How It Works</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>🔹 Release of Negative Ions (Anions):</strong> The
                  chip continuously releases negative ions when in contact with
                  moisture and heat, creating a protective environment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>🔹 Neutralizes Bacteria & Germs:</strong> These anions
                  inhibit bacterial growth, reducing the risk of infections and
                  discomfort.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>🔹 Odor Control Naturally:</strong> By minimizing
                  bacterial activity, anion chips prevent the buildup of
                  unpleasant odors without the use of harmful chemicals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>🔹 Supports pH Balance & Circulation:</strong> Anion
                  technology helps maintain vaginal pH balance and may improve
                  blood circulation, promoting overall menstrual well-being.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                <strong>Reduces Plastic Waste: </strong>Conventional pads

            <p class="faq-question">1. What are organic sanitary pads?</p>
            <p>
              Organic sanitary pads are made from natural, biodegradable
              materials like organic cotton and plant-based fibers. They are
              free from harmful chemicals, chlorine, fragrances, and synthetic
              materials, making them safer for both your body and the
              environment.

              2. What is an anion chip and how does it work?
            </p>
            <p>
              An anion chip is a special layer infused within the sanitary pad.
              It releases negative ions (anions) when activated by moisture and
              heat. These ions help inhibit bacterial growth, control odor
              naturally, balance pH levels, and provide added comfort during
              menstruation.
